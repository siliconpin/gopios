proprietary license restricts to share or gain knowledge, GPL or GNU license is the opposite, we have MIT and BSD that benefits conqueror company (* still using bsd under the hood and * using purchased qdos)

i hope rest of the people will become humanbeings. knowledge, experience, information will be free[please dont force to reverse eng., its better not to have any software or hardware with secret sauce]. A humanbeing without a driving license is much better than a person having a driving license, i wonder govt. dont provide a license to own a computer system but i need a license to run os on it?
the english word free is not enough, let me put this way : a book can have a price not the content and i must be able to share it.

praise to mukteshwar, hope one day licence raaj will be over till my work is under nirvána license and the terms and conditions are listed below
