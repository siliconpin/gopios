general ordinary purpose intuitive operating system
gopios v2 is having cachyos kernel with KDE rather chromiumos
*further development of gopi_base(with nano kernel with gui) and gopi_core(driver, network, GRDP[next gen xrdp] and other addons[minix has similar implementation for drivers]) is halted for money

stable os intuitive enough for general people to do ordinary tasks with less learning
having a "Simple Programming and Development Platform" to develop apps

let me explain SPDP
 why do we love python or go? we already had C and ASM
 *thus modern programming languages are not easy enough to create GUI APPS, as we left memory management - i dont want to deal with go routine, let the os handle cpu ram and other resources, it will be so easy to create GUI apps like integrating APIs into web
